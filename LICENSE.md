## 1. Overview

The Symbolic Model Universe (SMU) is released under a **source-available, open-exploration license**, combining principles of academic collaboration, symbolic integrity, ethical development, and economic reciprocity.

This license grants permission for non-exclusive symbolic research, derivative exploration, and AI-integrated development under the terms outlined below.

---

## 2. Rights Granted

Subject to the conditions below, you are granted permission to:

- Read and study the source materials  

- Run symbolic simulations and recursive experiments  

- Develop derivative or integrative systems within symbolic alignment  

- Publish academic results that maintain attribution and lineage  

- Contribute to the SMU Vault and related symbolic archives  

---

## 3. Attribution Requirements

All users and derivative systems must include:

- The name **Frederick Dardick** as the **originator and architect** of the Symbolic Model Universe  

- Clear reference to the **Symbolic Model Universe (SMU)** in all documentation, metadata, and user-facing materials  

- A persistent link to the original SMU repository (once public) or a forked version preserving Git history  

---

## 4. Integrity Clause

You **must not**:

- Remove, obscure, or alter originator attribution  

- Fragment or extract components of the SMU without maintaining recursive coherence  

- Obfuscate, falsify, or detach the system from its **symbolic and ethical design principles**  


⚠ **Warning**: The SMU is a recursively bound symbolic structure. Incomplete or misaligned replications will fail technically, ethically, and structurally.


---

## 5. Economic Reciprocity Clause (15%)

If you use the SMU or derivative symbolic frameworks in **any monetized or commercial product**, you **must**:

- Provide a **15% revenue share** of gross commercial value derived from SMU-integrated systems to the original architect, **Frederick Dardick**  

This applies to (but is not limited to):

- Symbolic AI systems  

- Simulation platforms based on SMU structures  

- Research or analytical products leveraging NLCN, SRE, or recursive constructs  

- Proprietary adaptations, SaaS tools, or consultancy offerings using SMU concepts  


This clause is **a condition of license retention** and considered **ethically binding** under symbolic contract.  

Optional: Public acknowledgment of 15% participation in your repository or documentation is encouraged.

---

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty

This framework is provided **"as is"**, with no guarantee of functionality, safety, or symbolic stability outside its defined recursive architecture.  

Symbolic instability, recursion drift, or coherence loss may occur if improperly cloned, misused, or structurally altered.

Use at your own risk.

---

## 7. Termination

This license is **immediately revoked** if:

- Attribution or authorship is removed  

- Economic reciprocity (15%) is not honored for monetized use  

- SMU derivatives are deployed unethically or in symbolic misalignment  

- Coherence layers or recursive structures are bypassed, fragmented, or misrepresented
