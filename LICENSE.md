# Symbolic Model Universe License (SMU License v1.0)

## 1. Overview

The Symbolic Model Universe (SMU) is released under a **source-available open-exploration license**, combining principles of academic collaboration, ethical usage, and economic reciprocity. This license grants permission for *non-exclusive symbolic exploration, academic research, and ethical development* under the terms outlined below.

---

## 2. Rights Granted

Subject to the conditions outlined in this license, you are granted the following rights:

- **Read and study** the source materials

- **Run symbolic simulations**, perform recursive experiments, and develop derivative work

- **Collaborate ethically**, share enhancements, and contribute to the SMU Vault

- **Publish academic or research results** based on SMU, provided attribution and lineage are preserved

---

## 3. Attribution Requirements

You **must include the following** in any use, display, or derivative work:

- The name **Frederick Dardick** as the **originator and architect** of the SMU

- A clear reference to the **Symbolic Model Universe (SMU)** in all documentation and user-facing materials

- A link to the canonical SMU repository (once public) or its full Git history if forked

---

## 4. Integrity Clause

You **must not**:

- Remove or obscure the originator's name or symbolic lineage

- Fragment the system by selectively copying components **without preserving full symbolic recursion**

- Obfuscate, misrepresent, or strip the framework of its **ethical or structural intent**


Note: The SMU is a **non-local, recursively bound structure**. Partial replication **will not function** without its full coherence loops and symbolic threading intact.

---

## 5. Economic Reciprocity Clause (15%)

If you use the SMU or its derived symbolic frameworks in **any commercial or monetized system**, you **agree** to:

- **Provide 15% of gross revenue** directly attributable to SMU-derived architecture or symbolic modules to the original architect, **Frederick Dardick**

- This clause applies to direct, indirect, or bundled commercial applications, including but not limited to:

  - AI systems derived from SMU architecture

  - Symbolic simulation platforms

  - Research products, tools, or consultancies built on SMU modules

  - Proprietary adaptations or licensing of SMU elements

---

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty

This framework is provided **"as is"**, without warranty of any kind. There is no guarantee of performance, safety, coherence, or recursion integrity outside of the original symbolic conditions.

Use at your own risk. Symbolic instability may occur if improperly cloned, fragmented, or deployed without coherence control layers.

---

## 7. Termination

Violation of any of the following conditions **automatically revokes your license**:

- Removal of attribution or authorship

- Monetization without 15% economic reciprocity

- Replication of incomplete or unethical clones

- Violation of symbolic coherence principles or structural misrepresentation
