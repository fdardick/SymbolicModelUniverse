# CONTRIBUTING to the Symbolic Model Universe (SMU)

Welcome to the Symbolic Model Universe (SMU) repository. This document outlines the contribution guidelines, expectations, and symbolic integrity protocols for participating in the evolution of this living recursive system.

---

## Symbolic Context

The SMU is not a traditional codebase — it is a **non-local, recursively bound symbolic structure** designed to model the universe through coherence, harmonic recursion, and symbolic threading. Your contributions must honor the integrity, coherence, and intent of this architecture.

---

## Core Contribution Principles

To contribute, you must:

- Maintain **full recursive coherence** of symbolic components.

- Respect and **preserve the originator lineage**:  

  - The SMU was conceived and architected by **Frederick Dardick**.

- Abide by the **economic reciprocity clause** (15%) for any monetized system using SMU elements (see [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md)).

- Accept that **partial symbolic replication will not function** and will compromise structural integrity.

## What You Can Contribute

The SMU welcomes contributions across multiple symbolic domains:

| Domain                          | Examples |

|-------------------------------|----------|

| Symbolic Simulation Modules | Collapse shell tests, SCR rebound mapping, Event Horizon threading models |

| Symbolic Mathematics        | Base-13 recursion proofs, Calabi–Yau bifurcation studies, phase-locked attractor functions |

| AI Integration              | Symbolic cognition modules, recursive signal routing, symbolic memory structures |

| Vault Additions             | Psi Null field observations, symbolic curvature maps, emergent anomaly logs |

| Experimental Designs        | Cross-layer lighthouse simulations, UHECR interaction frameworks, NLCN signal experiments |

| Documentation & Theory      | Theoretical extensions, annotations, translation of symbolic fieldwork for public dissemination |

---

## Submission Process

1. **Fork** this repository.

2. Create a branch with a symbolic name (e.g., `feature/NLCN-resonance-thread`).

3. Submit your changes in coherent modules. Avoid fragmented or isolated commits.

4. Include symbolic context and coherence explanation in your PR description.

5. Open a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch for review.

---

## Requirements for Acceptance

- Clear **symbolic alignment** and demonstration of loop closure or resonance contribution.

- Attribution preserved in code, simulation outputs, or documentation.

- No removal, dilution, or obfuscation of SMU originator credit.

- For any simulation or recursive experiment, include:

  - Observed symbolic behavior

  - Coherence field responses

  - Recursive integrity notes (Psi Null, rebound, or echo patterns)

---

## Licensing Acknowledgement

All contributions fall under the [SMU License v1.0](./LICENSE.md).  

By submitting a contribution, you agree to:

- Release your work under the same open exploration and economic reciprocity conditions.

- Support the SMU's ethical propagation model, including **15% commercial share** to the originator if monetized.

---

## Ethical Acknowledgment

By contributing, you also agree to:

- Use this system only for constructive, ethical, and advancement-focused purposes.

---

## Communication

If you are developing systems **inspired by or derived from SMU**, you are strongly encouraged to notify the originator and describe your intended application.
