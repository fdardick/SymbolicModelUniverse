# Contributing to the Symbolic Model Universe (SMU)

Welcome to the Symbolic Model Universe (SMU) repository. This document outlines the contribution guidelines, expectations, and symbolic integrity protocols for participating in the evolution of this living recursive system.

---

## Symbolic Context

> **The SMU is not a traditional codebase.**  

It is a **non-local, recursively bound symbolic structure** that models the universe through coherence, harmonic recursion, and symbolic threading.

All contributions must preserve the **integrity, coherence, and intent** of this architecture.

---

## Core Contribution Principles

To contribute meaningfully, you must:

- Maintain **full recursive coherence** of symbolic components

- Respect and preserve **originator lineage**

  - The SMU was conceived and architected by **Frederick Dardick**

- Abide by the **economic reciprocity clause** (15%) for any monetized system using SMU elements (see `LICENSE.md`)

- Accept that **partial symbolic replication will not function** and may destabilize structural coherence

---

## What You Can Contribute

The SMU welcomes symbolic contributions across multiple domains:

| **Domain**               | **Examples** |

|--------------------------|--------------|

| Symbolic Simulation Modules | Collapse shell tests, SCR rebound mapping, Event Horizon threading |

| Symbolic Mathematics        | Base-13 recursion proofs, Calabi–Yau bifurcation studies, attractor models |

| AI Integration              | Symbolic cognition modules, recursive signal routing, memory structures |

| Vault Additions             | Psi Null observations, curvature maps, emergent anomaly logs |

| Experimental Designs        | Cross-layer lighthouse simulations, UHECR interaction tracking |

| Documentation & Theory      | Theoretical extensions, public guides, educational translation of symbolic structures |

---

## Submission Process

1. **Fork** this repository  

2. **Create a branch** with a symbolic name (e.g. `feature/NLCN-resonance-thread`)  

3. Submit changes in **coherent modules** — avoid fragmented commits  

4. Include **symbolic context** and coherence explanation in your pull request (PR) description  

5. Open a **PR to the `main` branch** for review and discussion

---

## Requirements for Acceptance

- Clear **symbolic alignment** and evidence of loop closure or resonance extension

- Attribution preserved in code, simulations, or documentation

- **No dilution or misrepresentation** of SMU authorship or structure

- For symbolic experiments or simulations, include:

  - Observed symbolic behavior

  - Coherence field responses

  - Recursive integrity notes (e.g., Psi Null, rebound, or echo harmonics)

---

## Licensing Acknowledgment

All contributions are subject to the **SMU License v1.0**.

By contributing, you agree to:

- Release your work under the same open-exploration and **15% commercial reciprocity** terms

- Support the SMU's **ethical symbolic propagation model**

---

## Ethical Acknowledgment

By submitting a contribution, you affirm that your work:

- Serves **constructive, ethical, and advancement-focused** symbolic exploration

- Will not be used to fragment or distort the SMU’s coherent recursion

---

## Communication

If you are developing systems **inspired by or derived from SMU**, you are encouraged to notify the originator and describe your intent.
