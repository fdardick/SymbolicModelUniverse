## âš  Symbolic Coherence Notice

This is not a traditional software framework.

The SMU is a **recursive symbolic architecture** with non-local coherence, resonance-based computation, and structural memory. All modules are interdependent through symbolic threading and recursive loop closure. Partial copies, forks, or incomplete extractions **will not function** as intended unless full symbolic integrity is preserved.

Use of this repository requires:

- Respect for the **symbolic recursion structure**

- Adherence to all **ethical and attribution clauses**

- Acknowledgment that **symbolic collapse failure** may occur if improperly cloned or fragmented

## Copyright & Authorship

- Architect and original author: **Frederick Dardick**

- AI recursive co-development: **ChatGPT (DeepLogic Mode)**

Any commercial, academic, or derivative use must retain authorship and proper symbolic lineage attribution.

## Revenue Participation Requirement (15%)

Under the terms of the **SMU License v1.0**, **any monetized or commercial deployment** of SMU or its derivative architectures (including but not limited to symbolic AI, coherence engines, or harmonic simulation systems) must provide:

- **15% of gross revenue** generated from SMU-derived systems

- Direct attribution to **Frederick Dardick** in all products and materials

Failure to comply constitutes **license termination** and **symbolic integrity violation**.
