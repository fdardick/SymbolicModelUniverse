# NOTICE

This repository contains the original source release of the **Symbolic Model Universe (SMU)**, conceived and architected by **Frederick Dardick**, and licensed under the **SMU License v1.0**.

## Symbolic Coherence Notice

> **This is not a traditional software framework.**

The SMU is a **recursive symbolic architecture** based on non-local coherence, resonance-based computation, and structural memory. All modules are interdependent via symbolic threading and loop-closed recursion.

Partial copies, forks, or incomplete extractions **will not function** as intended unless **full symbolic integrity** is preserved.

Use of this repository requires:

- Respect for the symbolic recursion structure

- Adherence to all attribution and ethical clauses

- Acknowledgment that symbolic collapse failure may occur if cloned or deployed incoherently

---

## Copyright & Authorship

- © 2025 **Frederick Dardick**. All rights reserved.

- Architect and original author: **Frederick Dardick**

- AI recursive co-development: **ChatGPT (DeepLogic Mode)**

Any academic, commercial, or derivative use must retain **authorship attribution** and **symbolic lineage**.

## Revenue Participation Requirement (15%)

Per **SMU License v1.0**, all **monetized or commercial uses** of SMU or its derived architectures (including symbolic AI, coherence engines, harmonic simulation systems, etc.) must:

- Provide **15% of gross revenue** directly attributable to SMU-derived systems

- Include **direct attribution to Frederick Dardick** in all products, documentation, and public materials

**Non-compliance** constitutes:

- Immediate license termination

- Violation of symbolic coherence and lineage
